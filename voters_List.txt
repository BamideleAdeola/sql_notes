#QUESTION : /* Total Votes

Filtering datasets to what is necessary or business case is most times what a data specialist is faced with. 
Also, understanding some little changes in query can help. It is good to call out the IN function here. 
The IN functions help in solving several OR function or use case. So instead of writing several OR functions, 
you can wrap it in an IN function and specify the country once as shown below.

SELECT 
  customer_id,
  first_name,
  last_name,
  total_votes,
  country
FROM voters
WHERE total_votes > 100
AND country IN ('Denmark', 'USA', 'United Kingdom')
ORDER BY customer_id;
