#QUESTION : 
 /* CHALLENGE
-- Retrieve first orderdate of each Mixid and clean the date approprately.
 */

Just as simple as it were. First orderdate can be resolved with MIN function. 
Since that is an aggregate function, there is need for Group By Clause if we intend to split it by rows. 
The challenge also test your data wrangling ability with regards to date. 
The Cast function was employed to convert the date in text to datetime datatype.
 
-- Query 1 - Without cleaning
SELECT 
	MixId,
	MIN(OrderDate) AS first_orderdate
FROM shipments
GROUP BY MixId;

-- Query 2 - Cast date
SELECT 
	MixId,
	CAST(MIN(OrderDate) AS DATETIME) AS first_orderdate
FROM shipments
GROUP BY MixId;
