#question : #Calculate the #RANGE of price column from the table foods using SQL. 
#SQL #MAX, #MIN() Function.
Currently, there is no direct way to calculate a range in both fundamental excel and SQL. 
However, by understanding of the concept of range in statistics, one can pull this through by using different functions.
Range in statistics is simply the difference between the highest and lowest values in a set of data.
Hence, to compute a range, use can subtract #MIN() Function (Lowest value) from #MAX() function (Highest value). And there you have a range. I have created a simple dataset for this purpose called the foods table with 3 columns: fd_group, fd_name, fd_price
I have also attached output as a snapshot of both the entire table and the range.

SELECT MAX(fd_price) - MIN(fd_price) AS range
FROM foods;
