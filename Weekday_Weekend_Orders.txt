#QUESTION : #Retrieve Weekday orders and Weekend Orders From Adventure2019 Database

According to international standard ISO 8601, Monday is the first day of the week. 
It is followed by Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, and Saturday. Sunday is the 7th and last day of the week.
By default in the business parlance, Saturdays and Sundays are regarded as weekends. So, weekend depends on your language or region.

Wearing the hat of a sales manager, I intend to divide my orders into WEEKEND ORDERS and WEEKDAY orders.

This might seem simple right, YES, you can use the DATENAME() function and a WHERE CLAUSE to quickly achieve this. 

My current date using a GETDATE() function returned FRIDAY, so I do not need to set any day or language.

To solve this challenge, I am using #AdventureWorks2019 database. If you do not have it, I could write a new post on how to load it in #SSMS some other time.


--Query 1: Weekend Orders
SELECT 
  SalesOrderID,
  OrderQty,
  DATENAME(dw, ModifiedDate) AS WeekendOrder
FROM Sales.SalesOrderDetail
WHERE DATENAME(dw, ModifiedDate) IN ('Saturday', 'Sunday');
go

--Query 2: Weekday Orders
SELECT 
  SalesOrderID,
  OrderQty,
  DATENAME(dw, ModifiedDate) AS WeekdayOrder
FROM Sales.SalesOrderDetail
WHERE DATENAME(dw, ModifiedDate) NOT IN ('Saturday', 'Sunday');
go

I will write on another way of achieving this challenge in another post.
