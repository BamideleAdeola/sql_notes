#QUESTION : #Count the number of Sundays till date

Attimes, we might want to count the numbers of sundays so far in the year. 

This was one of the discussion with my friend today and I thought of using #SQL to solve the problem. 

Yes, I declared the start date as '2022-01-01' and use the GETDATE() function for the end date. 

Also, with Common Table Expression (CTE) just to create a new table of all sundays from beginning of the year using the UNION ALL function. 

I also used the DATEADD function to create an incremental date from '2022-01-01' to less than or equal to current period (GETDATE()) Function.

Definitely, there are other ways of solving this challenge, I find this a bit straight forward. 

Have you ever worked on something like this before, please feel free to drop in the comment to continue learning.

It happened that today is the #45th sunday in the year 2022. And the first Sunday in 2022 was the 2nd of January, 2022 as shown in the snapshot.

Query1: -- The count of Sundays till date
DECLARE @startdate datetime = '2022-01-01';
DECLARE @enddate datetime = GETDATE(); -- Set the start and enddate

WITH Date_table(mydates) AS (
SELECT @startdate		
UNION ALL							
SELECT DATEADD(DAY, 1, mydates) FROM Date_table 
WHERE mydates <= @enddate
)

SELECT COUNT(mydates) AS No_of_Sundays
FROM Date_table 
WHERE DATENAME(WEEKDAY, mydates) IN ('Sunday')
OPTION (MAXRECURSION 0);


Query 2: Dates of Sundays in this year

DECLARE @startdate datetime = '2022-01-01';
DECLARE @enddate datetime = GETDATE(); -- Set the start and enddate

WITH Date_table(mydates) AS (
SELECT @startdate				
UNION ALL							
SELECT DATEADD(DAY, 1, mydates) FROM Date_table  --Increment each day till current date
WHERE mydates <= @enddate
)

SELECT mydates AS Dates_of_Sundays
FROM Date_table 
WHERE DATENAME(WEEKDAY, mydates) IN ('Sunday')
OPTION (MAXRECURSION 0);
