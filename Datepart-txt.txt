#QUESTION : #Return the datepart values of today.

If you have got to work with time series analysis, you will understand the importance of dissecting dates into different parts. 
The DATEPART() function returns a specific part of a date. It returns an integer which represents a specific part of a date. 
Sometimes as a data specialist, all you are interested in might be day, month, or a year for trend analysis. The DATEPART() Function comes handy here.
Please view the different syntax parts of a datepart here : https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/t-sql/functions/datepart-transact-sql?view=sql-server-ver16 

For date, DATEPART will accept a column expression, expression, string literal, or user-defined variable. 
Use four-digit years to avoid ambiguity issues. 

In next post, I will write on DATENAME() function which is similar to DATEPART(). 

I have Declared a variable called my currentdate with a DATETIME(2) datatype and assigned it to GETDATE() which is the current datetime value and a string output.

Surprisngly, today is day #304 of the year, isn't that great? 

DECLARE
	@mycurrentdate DATETIME2(7) = GETDATE();  -- MY CURRENT DATE AT THE TIME OF THIS QUERY

SELECT
	DATEPART(YEAR, @mycurrentdate) AS TheYear,
	DATEPART(MONTH, @mycurrentdate) AS TheMonth,
	DATEPART(DAY, @mycurrentdate) AS TheDay,
	DATEPART(DAYOFYEAR, @mycurrentdate) AS TheDayOfYear,
    -- Day of week is WEEKDAY
	DATEPART(WEEKDAY, @mycurrentdate) AS TheDayOfWeek,
	DATEPART(WEEK, @mycurrentdate) AS TheWeek,
	DATEPART(SECOND, @mycurrentdate) AS TheSecond,
	DATEPART(NANOSECOND, @mycurrentdate) AS TheNanosecond;
