#SQL Row_Number() Function.
If you are interested in knowing the total rows in your dataset by numbering them irrespective of ties, Then Row_number is a banger.
ROW_NUMBER and RANK are similar.ROW_NUMBER numbers all rows sequentially (e.g 1, 2, 3, 4, 5). 
RANK provides the same numeric value for ties (e.g 1, 2, 2, 4, 5).
Using our previous datasets on foods, let's combine Row_number, RANK and DENSE_Rank function.
When you omit the partition by clause, then you want to rank or find the row numbers of the entire dataset.
I have attached two snapshots of when Partition BY clause was introduced and not introduced in the query for better clarity. 
Trust you find this useful. 

In summary,
RANK = 2 people came 1st (by scoring 90 each), then the next is 3rd (Scores 85).
DENSE_RANK = 2 people came 1st (by scoring 90 each), then the next is 2nd (Scores 85).
ROW_NUMBER = 2 people came 1st (by scoring 90 each), they are numbered 1, 2 and the 3rd. Just normal numbering irrespective of ties.
