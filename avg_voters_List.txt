#QUESTION : /* Find Average total_votes of all voters residing in France, Germany and Switzerland by customer_id and country.
*/

#SQL can be fun with aggregate functions. 
The above challenge on average votes by customer_id and country definitely requires a GROUP BY statement. 
Also, including ordering statement with the query just for a simple clarification.
Trust you know that you can order by digits accordingly. 
Instead of calling the names of columns, you could just input numbers as seen below. 
Just that non technical people might not understand this or what do you think?
1 represent the first column in the select statement and 2, the second, etc.


Query 1
SELECT customer_id, country, AVG(total_votes) AS avg_votes
FROM voters
WHERE country IN ('France', 'Germany', 'Switzerland') 
GROUP BY customer_id, country
ORDER BY customer_id, country;


Query 2
SELECT customer_id, country, AVG(total_votes) AS avg_votes
FROM voters
WHERE country IN ('France', 'Germany', 'Switzerland') 
GROUP BY customer_id, country
ORDER BY 1, 2;
