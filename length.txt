#QUESTION : #Returns #DISTINCT country name and its #length (how many characters contain in the country column) from the envision table where the length of country is more than 8.

If you are a fan of #excel, the above challenge should not be difficult to attempt. 
I worked on a project back then where we had to validate phone nos. 
@Rasheed can attest to that. Our first call on excel was to quickly find the length of the phone number field since it is a large amount of data. 

Coming to #SQL, #Microsoft still maintain #LEN() to count the number of characters while PostgreSQL uses #LENGTH. 
I am putting it here that to count characters in #SQL
SQL Server - LEN()
PostgreSQL - LENGTH()

Just understanding the concept would help you move fast on this journey. 
  --#SQL Server
 SELECT 
	DISTINCT country,
	LEN(Country) AS 'Country Length'
FROM dbo.eurovision
WHERE LEN(Country) > 8;

  --#PostgreSQL
 SELECT 
	DISTINCT country,
	LENGTH(Country) AS Country_Length 
FROM eurovision
WHERE LENGTH(Country) > 8;
