#QUESTION : 
1. #Find 45 days from today. 
2. Considering our expected ship date is 20 days after a completed order, find the expected ship date.

#SQL #DATEADD() Function

If you work in the Logistics service sector, you would know that there is an average days a need needs to be shipped.

This gives rise to adding these days to the order date which is generated immediately a proposed buyer completes his/her order. 

In that context, DATEADD can adds or subtracts a number to a datepart of an input date and returns the date.

SYNTAX:
DATEADD (datepart , number , date )

Using the Northwind database with some random business case of 20 days benchmark for orders to be shipped

-- Query 1
SELECT 
  DATEADD(day, 45, getdate()) AS FourtyFiveDaysFromNow; -- 45 Days from today is 2022-12-18 07:53:30.110
GO

-- Query 2
SELECT 
    Orderid,
	OrderDate,
	DATEADD(DAY, 20, OrderDate) As ProposedShipeddate, -- 20 Days plus OrderDate
	ShippedDate,
	DATEDIFF(DAY, DATEADD(DAY, 20, OrderDate), ShippedDate) AS DaysDue
FROM dbo.orders;
GO

On the eye level, the output shows that at 10302 had an extra 9 days after the 20 days benchmark and order 10305 had 6. 

Every other orders with a negative DaysDue were shipped earlier than the ProposedShippedDate.

We can then move forward to drill down into what could have caused delay in shippment. 

#NOTE: On a second note, wouldn't have been better to remove weekends from these days? Checkout for my next post on this.
