#QUESTION : Replace the NULLs in IncidentState column with values in City Column using #ISNULL() Function

While working on a project, I wrote a query and it threw an error. With that in mind, I decided to make research and came up with the following.

ISNULL is not IS NULL. 

ISNULL() function lets you return an alternative value when an expression is NULL. 
IS NULL operator list all records that have no values. 

Not to be confused, I went further to see if there are differences between ISNULL and COALESCE function which I will show in another post. 
So, a column value is NULL if it does not exist. Hence IS NULL operator is used to display all the rows for columns that do not have a value.

For Example: If you want to find the names of students (from a student_register table) who do not participate in any games, the query should be:
SELECT full_name FROM student_register WHERE games IS NULL;
Hence, IS NULL is used as a filter while ISNULL can be used to replace COALESCE but beware of performance, its syntax and other conditions.

The objective here is to show that you can use ISNULL to replace null values in a column with values in another column. 

I have shared two screenshots to better understand this. 

The first show the full query without a filter by IS NULL while the second included an IS NULL Operator to filter out only the null rows.

-- Query 1
SELECT 
	IncidentState, 
	ISNULL(IncidentState, City) AS MyNewLocation  -- Replace nulls with values in the City column
FROM Incidents;


-- Query 2
SELECT 
	IncidentState, 
	ISNULL(IncidentState, City) AS MyNewLocation  -- Replace nulls with values in the City column
FROM Incidents
-- Filter to only return missing values from IncidentState
WHERE IncidentState IS NULL;

Trust you find this useful.
