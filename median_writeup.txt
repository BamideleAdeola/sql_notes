#QUESTION : #Calculate the #MEAN and #MEDIAN of price column from the table foods using SQL. 
#SQL #Median
I haven't seen a direct way to compute median in SQL. Most of the methods were either somewhat difficult or not code friendly.
However, with the #PERCENTILE_CONT() Function in #PostgreSQL with a WITHIN GROUP, you can have your median without a fuss.
Traditionally, median is the middle value of an array arranged in either ascending or descending order. 
The within group clause, percentile_cont function and ordering ascending order based on the price column would solve this challenge.
There were 10 entries in the dataset and 2 middle values, which are 70 and 65. By default, the median would be average of these values. 
Hence, the query returned 67.5, which is the correct value for median.

How are you computing your own median? See screenshot.

SELECT
	AVG(fd_price) AS mean,
	PERCENTILE_CONT(0.5) WITHIN GROUP (ORDER BY fd_price) AS median
FROM foods;
