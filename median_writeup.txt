#QUESTION : #Calculate the #MEAN and #MEDIAN of price column from the table foods using SQL. 
#SQL #Median
I haven't seen a direct way to compute median in SQL. Most of the methods were either somewhat difficult or not code friendly.
However, with the #PERCENTILE_CONT() Function in PostgreSQL with a WITHIN GROUP, you can have your median without a fuss.
How are you computing your own median? See screenshot.

SELECT
	AVG(fd_price) AS mean,
	PERCENTILE_CONT(0.5) WITHIN GROUP (ORDER BY fd_price) AS median
FROM foods;

Trust you find this useful.
