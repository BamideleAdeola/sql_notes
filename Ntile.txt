#question : How can I perform Quartiles, percentiles, etc in #SQL
#SQL #NTILE() Function.
If your intention is to group rows of datasets into different groups like Quartile, percentile, etc. 
The Ntile function can be used in this regard.
This function is used to distribute rows of an ordered partition into a pre-defined number ðŸ‘Ž of approximately equal groups. 
Each row group gets its rank based on the defined condition and starts numbering from one group. 
It assigns a bucket number for every row in a group representing the group to which it belongs.
Using our previous datasets on foods, let's dive into rows grouping.
The challenge here is to group the data into 4 different groups. i.e Quartile based on the price.
--NTILE() function for a quartile
SELECT fd_name AS food, fd_price As price,
 NTILE (4) OVER (ORDER BY fd_price DESC) AS quartile
FROM foods;
