#QUESTION : 
 /* CHALLENGE
Show all of the voters grouped into voting_group of their total_votes.
Show the total no of voters in each voting_group.
Order the list by the vote_group in decending Order.

e.g, if total vote is between 10 to 19 they should fall in voting_group 10, 
20-29 = voting_group 20, 100-109 = voting_group 100 , etc.
 */

In solving the above challenge, understanding the floor() function is of importance. 
The FLOOR() function returns the largest integer value that is smaller than or equal to a number.
Hence, dividing the total votes into groups of 10 would mean that you divide the vote by 10, 
floor it to remove the decimal parts of the output then multiply the outcome by 10 since it has to be grouped in tens.

e.g votes of 185/10 = 18.5
when you floor 18.5, output would be 18 (removing the decimal parts)
then you can multiple the output by 10 which will group 185 as 180. 

SELECT 
  FLOOR(total_votes / 10) * 10 AS voting_group,
  COUNT(*) AS voters_in_each_group
FROM voters
GROUP BY FLOOR(total_votes / 10) * 10
ORDER BY voting_group DESC;
