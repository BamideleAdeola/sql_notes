#QUESTION : Calculate the running total
A running total is the summation of a sequence of numbers which is updated each time a number is added to the sequence, 
by adding the value of the new number to the previous running total.

In a simpler context, a running total, or cumulative sum, is a value that indicates the total of a value in the current row and all rows above it.

 --#SQL #server 

 SELECT 
	DISTINCT country,
	LEN(Country) AS 'Country Length'
FROM dbo.eurovision
WHERE LEN(Country) > 8;

 --#PostgreSQL
 SELECT 
	DISTINCT country,
	LENGTH(Country) AS Country_Length 
FROM eurovision
WHERE LENGTH(Country) > 8;
