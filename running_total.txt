#QUESTION : Calculate the #running #total or #cumulative #points of game played in eurovision table.

Having used #PowerBI to a great extent, one of my first challenge from client back then was calculating running or cumulative total.

A running total is the summation of a sequence of numbers which is updated each time a number is added to the sequence, 
by adding the value of the new number to the previous running total.
In a simpler context, a running total, or cumulative sum, is a value that indicates the total of a value in the current row and all rows above it.
The objective here is just to show at the simpler level of how to use window function to calculate running total with just one line of code.

SELECT
	id,
	Country,
	Points,
	SUM(Points) OVER (ORDER BY id ASC) AS RunningTotal  -- cumulative addition of points
FROM eurovision;
