#QUESTION : #Return the datepart values of today.

Based on my last post on Datepart function, today we will look into the other variant of the function which is DATENAME() function.
If you intend to return a specific part of a date in string, then use DATENAME. 

While DATEPART returns Integer, DATENAME returns a string. 

Please view the different syntax parts of a datename and datepart here respectively : 
https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/t-sql/functions/datename-transact-sql?view=sql-server-ver16
https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/t-sql/functions/datepart-transact-sql?view=sql-server-ver16 

For date, DATENAME and DATEPART will accept a column expression, expression, string literal, or user-defined variable. 
Use four-digit years to avoid ambiguity issues. 


I have Declared 2 variables called my currentdate1 and  currentdate2 with a DATETIME(2) datatype and assigned it to GETDATE() which is the current datetime value and a string output.

currentdate1 to explain the output of DATEPART() Function
currentdate2 to explain the output of DATENAME() Function

#OBSERVATION: Both DATEPART and DATENAME returns similar values in all columns apart from the MONTH and DayoftheWeek columns.

-- Query 1

DECLARE
	@mycurrentdate1 DATETIME2(7) = GETDATE();  -- MY CURRENT DATE AT THE TIME OF THIS QUERY for dateoart

SELECT
	DATEPART(YEAR, @mycurrentdate1) AS TheYear,
	DATEPART(MONTH, @mycurrentdate1) AS TheMonth,
	DATEPART(DAY, @mycurrentdate1) AS TheDay,
	DATEPART(DAYOFYEAR, @mycurrentdate1) AS TheDayOfYear,
    -- Day of week is WEEKDAY
	DATEPART(WEEKDAY, @mycurrentdate1) AS TheDayOfWeek,
	DATEPART(WEEK, @mycurrentdate1) AS TheWeek,
	DATEPART(SECOND, @mycurrentdate1) AS TheSecond,
	DATEPART(NANOSECOND, @mycurrentdate1) AS TheNanosecond;

-- Query 2

DECLARE
	@mycurrentdate2 DATETIME2(7) = GETDATE();    --MY CURRENT DATE AT THE TIME OF THIS QUERY for datename
SELECT
	DATENAME(YEAR, @mycurrentdate2) AS TheYear,
	DATENAME(MONTH, @mycurrentdate2) AS TheMonth,
	DATENAME(DAY, @mycurrentdate2) AS TheDay,
	DATEPART(DAYOFYEAR, @mycurrentdate2) AS TheDayOfYear,
    -- Day of week is WEEKDAY
	DATENAME(WEEKDAY, @mycurrentdate2) AS TheDayOfWeek,
	DATENAME(WEEK, @mycurrentdate2) AS TheWeek,
	DATENAME(SECOND, @mycurrentdate2) AS TheSecond,
	DATENAME(NANOSECOND, @mycurrentdate2) AS TheNanosecond;
