#QUESTION : #Retrieve voters firstname starting with vowels (a,e,i,o,u) from voters table.

As a data specialist, understanding string functions is of high importance. 

In solving the issue above, your ability to critically dissect, digest and bisect the challenge will come to play here. 

Most often, some challenges warrant that you breakdown the question into smaller parts, then recouple it. 

For the above challenge, I have provided 3 queries using 3 different approaches;
1. Wildcard
2. Left
3. SUbstring

--Query 1 -- using wildcard function
SELECT DISTINCT first_name
FROM voters
WHERE first_name LIKE '[a,e,i,o,u]%';

--Query 2 -- Using left function
SELECT DISTINCT first_name
FROM voters
WHERE LEFT (first_name, 1) IN ('a','e','i','o','u');

--Query 3 -- Using substring function
SELECT DISTINCT first_name
FROM voters
WHERE SUBSTRING(first_name, 1, 1) IN ('a','e','i','o','u');

Feel free to try it out with any string data and see if you are able to come up with required output.

Trust you find this useful.
