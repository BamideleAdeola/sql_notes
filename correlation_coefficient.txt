#QUESTION : #Calculate the correlation coefficient for the relation between x and y
This was the question I got sometimes back in my SQL journey. 
Fortunately for me I was using PostgreSQL and SQL Server (T-SQL). 
But then, I had to use google a bit. My surprise was that PostgreSQL has a function #CORR and I couldn't find it on SQL Server. 
#CORR is supported by 
- PostgreSQL
- Oracle
Not supported by
-MySQL
-MS-SQL
-Sqlite 

Please do not be confused, first of, just understand the statistics concept and its usage. 

Personally, I termed correlation as the #DEGREE of #relationship. i.e the strength of relationship. 

How strong are two or more variables related. So it ranges between -1<= corr <= 1

a value of 1 for a perfect correlation. 
a value of 0 for no correlation.
a value of -1 for a perfect negative correlation 

Hence, there could be a weak relationship or correlation and strong correlation between 2 variables. 

I have curated a simple dataset I got online for this exercise and also used SQL Server and PostgreSQL for the solution.

--#SQL Server
 SELECT (Avg(x * y) - (Avg(x) * Avg(y))) / (StDevP(x) * StDevP(y)) AS Pearsons_corr
  FROM correlation;

--#PostgreSQL
SELECT 
  CORR (x, y)
FROM correlation;

Currently, how do you calculate correlation coefficient from your end. Let me get your thoughts on the chat box.
