The beauty of SQL is seen when you breakdown challenge or questions into smaller units as seen above. 
The query test several skills within SQL. 
1. Wildcards
2. date manipulations
3. The between operator
4. even/odd no manipulations or modulus
etc. 

SELECT * 
FROM voters 
WHERE first_name  LIKE '__a%'
 AND gender = 'M'
 AND month(birthdate) IN (2, 6, 12)
 AND total_votes BETWEEN 50 AND 130
 AND customer_id % 2 = 1
 AND (country = 'Switzerland');
