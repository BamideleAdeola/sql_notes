#QUESTION : #Retrieve the century of date of births from the table centdata.



I hope you know that 19th (nineteenth) century began on 1 January 1801, and ended on 31 December 1900. I knew later in my career actually too actually. Sure that a lot would know this. However, how do we confirm what century a date is? That is the main challenge in this write up. 



Generally speaking, a century is a period of 100 years. However, it is worthy of note that we can retrieve the centuries of dates from SQL in different ways.



All it takes is to understand some simple mathematical concept. 



I have displayed two approaches to solving this issue on the snapshot. 

 

First approach is to subtract 1 from the Year of birth, divide the result by 100 then add the output to 1. This follows the rule of BODMAS. 



Second approach subtracts the lower and upper limit of the century e.g 2000 - 1901 which is 20th century and is definitely 99, add it to the year of birth then divide the result by 100.



SELECT 

	id,

	date_of_birth,

	1 + (YEAR(date_of_birth) - 1)/100 AS century1,

	(YEAR(date_of_birth) + 99) / 100 as century2

FROM centdata;



It is important to mention that SUBSTRING could also be used to achieve this output. 



Let me know in the comment box which of these two approach you find straight forward and easy to use. 



Trust you find this useful.
