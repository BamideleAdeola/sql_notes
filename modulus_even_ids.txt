#QUESTION : Retrieve a list of first and last names of voters with an even customer_id number. 
Exclude duplicates from the output.

To solve the challenge above, one should have idea of modulus function. 

I have seen developers used modulus in different applications. 

Modulus returns the remainder of one number divided by another. MYSQL, PostgreSQL have the function as MOD().

However, in SQL Server with the %, we can call the MOD Function. 

SELECT 
  DISTINCT  customer_id, first_name, last_name
FROM voters
WHERE customer_id % 2 = 0; -- remainder 0 for even numbers
